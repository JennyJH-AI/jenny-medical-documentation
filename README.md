# Post-Viral Multi-System Syndrome: 5+ Year Longitudinal Case Study
*Research-Grade Documentation for Medical Education & Collaborative Research*

---

## 🔬 Research Opportunity Overview

This repository contains **unprecedented comprehensive documentation** of post-viral multi-system syndrome progression from acute onset (November 10, 2019) through current active deterioration (June 2025). The case represents a unique research opportunity with systematic data collection, professional baseline documentation, and real-time progression capture.

## 📊 Unique Research Value

### **Baseline Documentation Excellence**
- **Professional dancer background**: Elite proprioceptive training provides enhanced sensitivity to neurological changes
- **Pre-illness health**: Previously healthy 27-year-old with comprehensive baseline data
- **Systematic tracking**: Daily symptom documentation from disease onset

### **Unprecedented Medical Patterns**
- **Extreme immune oscillation**: 235% lymphocyte swing with complete reversal documented over 98 days
- **Sequential cranial nerve involvement**: Systematic progression through multiple cranial nerves within 26 days
- **Laboratory-clinical paradox**: Best laboratory values in 5+ years concurrent with worst neurological symptoms

### **Multi-Institutional Validation**
- **Mayo Clinic**: Comprehensive evaluation (March 2020)
- **University of Utah Health**: Surgical inflammatory response analysis (2023)
- **Benefis Health System**: 5+ years primary care documentation
- **Great Falls Clinic**: Current laboratory monitoring

## 🎯 Current Research Window

### **Active Disease Progression** *(Time-Sensitive Opportunity)*
- **Neurological event acceleration**: Multiple discrete episodes in recent weeks
- **Respiratory control dysfunction**: Loss of automatic breathing drive documented May 26, 2025
- **Motor system deterioration**: Progressive freeze states affecting feeding and mobility
- **Real-time documentation**: Video evidence and vital sign correlation during episodes

### **Research Questions This Case Can Address**
1. **Post-viral syndrome pathophysiology**: Inflammatory to structural disease transition
2. **Immune system recovery patterns**: Long-term trajectory analysis
3. **Neurological progression markers**: Early warning sign identification
4. **Professional baseline significance**: Enhanced detection sensitivity in trained populations
