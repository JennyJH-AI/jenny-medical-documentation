- **Arrhythmias**: 8 supraventricular beats, 1 SVT episode
- **Symptom correlation**: Normal rhythm during ALL patient-reported symptoms

**Clinical significance**: Severe autonomic dysfunction with inverted circadian pattern*

#### **Laboratory Findings - March 2020**
**Thyroid crisis and recovery**:
- **March 11**: TSH 5.6 mIU/L (HIGH)

### **Provider Assessments**

#### **Dr. Murali Duggirala (Primary Care)**
**Clinical impression**:
- **Fevers**: "I do not think her temperatures are consistently over 100.5"
- **Migraines**: "Do not know if there is analgesic rebound"
- **Assessment**: Attributed symptoms primarily to psychiatric conditions and drug interactions

#### **Dr. Daniel Desimone (Infectious Disease)**
**Clinical conclusion**: "My suspicion of an underlying infection given her symptoms, the duration of illness, and prior ID workup that was negative including extensive lab testing and imaging (CT, MRI) is very low."

**Key finding**: "Extensive MAJOR drug-drug interactions. I suspect her symptoms are likely most attributed to these interactions."*

#### **Dr. Mark Whealy (Neurology)**
**Final neurological diagnoses**:
1. New daily persistent headache - chronic migraine phenotype
2. Tremors: "Likely enhancing physiological tremor and/or functional tremor"
3. Dizziness of unclear etiology*

## **HEALTHCARE SYSTEM RESPONSES**

### **Provider Pattern Analysis**
**Consistent themes across multiple providers**:
1. **Symptom minimization**: Despite objective abnormalities
2. **Psychiatric attribution**: Symptoms attributed to mental health
3. **Drug interaction focus**: Blamed on medication interactions
4. **Functional diagnosis**: "Functional" rather than organic etiology
5. **No structural findings**: Used to dismiss severity

### **Mayo Clinic Paradox**
**Objective abnormalities documented**:
- **Holter monitor**: Severe autonomic dysfunction with inverted circadian rhythm
- **Thyroid crisis**: TSH 5.6 → 3.3 mIU/L in 48 hours
- **ANA elevation**: 1.3 U (ongoing autoimmune activity)

**Provider conclusions**: 
- Attributed to psychiatric conditions and drug interactions
- Dismissed objective autonomic dysfunction
- No organic explanation provided for documented abnormalities*

### **Diagnostic Limitations**
**Comprehensive negative workup**:
- **Structural imaging**: Normal brain MRI, multiple CT scans
- **Infectious studies**: Negative for major pathogens
- **Autoimmune panels**: Minimal activity only
- **Cardiac structure**: Normal echocardiogram

**Functional abnormalities documented**:
- **Autonomic**: Severe dysfunction on Holter monitor
- **Endocrine**: Acute thyroiditis with rapid recovery
- **Immune**: Extreme oscillation patterns
- **Neurological**: Sequential cranial nerve involvement*

## **PROFESSIONAL BASELINE DISRUPTION**

### **Elite Proprioceptive System Override**
**Professional context**: Professional ballerina with elite spatial awareness  
**Baseline function**: Complex choreography requiring precise balance and coordination

**Documented deterioration**:
- **January 2**: "Hard time lifting legs, turning is no-go"
- **January 15**: "Balance noted as 'wonky' - increasing from weeks prior, happens at random"
- **January 16**: Kitchen collapse requiring all-fours position
- **January 19**: Movement-triggered crisis with face-first fall

### **Clinical Significance**
**Neurological disruption magnitude**:
- Complete override of elite proprioceptive training
- Random balance failure in controlled environments
- Movement hypersensitivity development
- Progressive motor control deterioration

**Diagnostic implications**:
- Balance dysfunction in professional dancer represents massive CNS disruption
- Would be minimized in general population but significant given baseline
- Indicates structural or functional brainstem/cerebellar involvement*
