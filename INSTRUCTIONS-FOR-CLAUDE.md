- **2020-2023**: Chronic adaptation phase with gradual recovery of some systems
- **2024-2025**: Current crisis with neurological deterioration despite immune recovery

### **Laboratory Evolution Patterns**
- **Immune System**: WBC 7.5 K/uL (Jan 2025) - best in 5+ years
- **Kidney Function**: BUN 15â†’24 mg/dL during acute phase, 2+ year recovery
- **Liver Function**: Cyclical dysfunction during crisis periods

- **Timeline accuracy**: Exact dates and quantitative data
- **Pattern recognition**: Statistical analysis and correlations

## PROJECT GOAL
This system eliminates the need to repeat medical context in every new Claude conversation. Any new chat can read this file and immediately understand the complete medical situation.
