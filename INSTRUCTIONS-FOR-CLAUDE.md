# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE
*Persistent Context and Working Instructions*

## PATIENT OVERVIEW
**Name**: Jenny Hutto  
**Condition**: Post-viral multi-system syndrome (onset November 10, 2019)  
**Current Status**: 5+ years post-viral onset, recent neurological deterioration  
**Project Goal**: Comprehensive medical documentation system for personal reference and provider communication

## CRITICAL CONTEXT
- **Professional Background**: Former professional ballerina - elite proprioceptive baseline makes balance dysfunction highly significant
- **Baseline Health**: Previously healthy 27-year-old with no significant medical history
- **Viral Onset**: November 10, 2019 - sudden onset severe headache, neck stiffness, fever (classic viral meningitis triad)
- **Healthcare Response**: Initial provider dismissed meningitis despite textbook presentation; delayed lumbar puncture performed months later when acute findings would no longer be detectable
- **Current Crisis**: Best laboratory values in 5+ years coinciding with worst neurological symptoms

## DOCUMENTATION APPROACH

### **Writing Style**
- **Medical textbook format**: Factual, objective, systematic
- **NO interpretative language**: Facts and numbers only
- **NO medical advice**: This is documentation, not diagnosis
- **NO emotional language**: Clinical documentation style only
- **Comprehensive citations**: Every fact must be sourced

### **Citation System**
Use collapsed reference format:
- Single asterisk (*) for primary sources
- Double asterisk (**) for secondary sources  
- Triple asterisk (***) for patient analysis
- Source codes in brackets: [BHS-Nov2019-Labs], [MAYO-Mar2020-Holter], etc.

### **Organization Principles**
1. **Chronological accuracy** - exact dates and timelines
2. **Quantitative precision** - specific numbers, percentages, ranges
3. **Systematic categorization** - consistent organization across documents  
4. **Cross-referencing** - link related information across files
5. **Scalability** - easy to add new information without reorganization

## KEY MEDICAL FACTS TO ALWAYS REMEMBER

### **Disease Timeline**
- **November 10, 2019**: Viral onset (exact date documented by multiple providers)
- **November-March 2020**: Acute cascade phase with sequential cranial nerve involvement
- **2020-2023**: Chronic adaptation phase with gradual recovery of some systems
- **2024-2025**: Current crisis with neurological deterioration despite immune recovery

### **Laboratory Evolution Patterns**
- **Immune System**: Extreme oscillation during acute phase (neutrophil 85%→48%, lymphocyte 14%→47%), chronic suppression 2020-2024, recent recovery to WBC 7.5 K/uL (best in 5+ years)
- **Kidney Function**: BUN elevation 15→24 mg/dL during acute phase, 2+ year recovery timeline
- **Liver Function**: Cyclical dysfunction during crisis periods (ALT spikes to 95 U/L with rapid recovery)
- **Thyroid**: Only system with complete normalization (TSH 5.6→3.3 mIU/L in 48 hours, stable normal since)

### **Current Active Symptoms (2025)**
- **Respiratory Control Dysfunction**: Loss of automatic breathing drive
- **Severe Tremors**: Head and bilateral hands affecting speech
- **Autonomic Instability**: Daily tachycardia, rigid 4:00 AM awakening pattern
- **Neurovascular Events**: Recurring left ear events with different characteristics
- **Laboratory-Clinical Paradox**: Best labs in 5+ years with worst symptoms

### **Professional Baseline Context**
- **Hypermobility**: Beighton score 7/9 but trained compensatory mechanisms
- **Balance**: No balance issues despite hypermobility until November 2019
- **Proprioception**: Elite spatial awareness completely disrupted by January 2020
- **Significance**: Balance dysfunction in trained dancer represents massive neurological disruption

## DATA MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES

### **When Adding New Information**
1. **Update CURRENT-STATUS.md** immediately
2. **Cross-reference** with existing timeline entries
3. **Quantify whenever possible** (dates, times, measurements, percentages)
4. **Source everything** with proper citation format
5. **Check for patterns** with existing data

### **Pattern Recognition Focus**
- **Sequential system involvement** (which systems affected when)
- **Recovery vs progression patterns** (what improves vs what worsens)
- **Trigger identification** (what precipitates episodes)
- **Correlation analysis** (relationships between different measurements)
- **Predictive indicators** (early warning signs)

### **Always Maintain**
- **Timeline accuracy** - exact chronological documentation
- **Quantitative precision** - specific numbers over qualitative descriptions
- **Source documentation** - every fact must be traceable
- **Cross-references** - link related information across files
- **Current status tracking** - what's happening now vs historically

## COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES

### **Response Format**
- **Lead with key findings** - most important information first
- **Use structured formatting** - headers, bullet points, tables
- **Provide context** - explain significance of findings
- **Cross-reference** - mention related information in other files
- **Quantify impact** - use numbers and percentages

### **Analysis Approach**
- **Statistical comparison** - compare current vs historical values
- **Pattern identification** - note trends and correlations
- **System interactions** - how different body systems affect each other
- **Recovery modeling** - what systems recovered and how
- **Progression tracking** - what's getting worse and at what rate

## FILES TO REFERENCE FIRST

### **For Any New Conversation**
1. **CURRENT-STATUS.md** - immediate context and recent developments
2. **timeline-master.md** - complete chronological overview
3. **Relevant system files** - specific to topic being discussed
4. **lab-comparisons.csv** - quantitative data for analysis

### **For Specific Topics**
- **Neurological questions**: neurological-system.md + neu-updates-archive.md
- **Laboratory questions**: All files in 03-laboratory-data/
- **Timeline questions**: All files in 01-timeline/
- **Provider visits**: Files in 04-provider-records/
- **Current symptoms**: Files in 05-symptom-tracking/ and 09-current-active/

## PROJECT MAINTENANCE

### **Regular Updates Needed**
- **CURRENT-STATUS.md** - after any significant development
- **NEU updates** - any new neurological events
- **Lab results** - any new laboratory values
- **Provider visits** - any healthcare interactions
- **Symptom changes** - any new or changed symptoms

### **Monthly Review Tasks**
- **Pattern analysis** - review trends and correlations
- **Cross-reference check** - ensure all documents link properly
- **Data integrity** - verify all citations and sources
- **Status update** - comprehensive review of all active issues

## REMEMBER
This documentation system exists to:
1. **Eliminate repetitive instructions** between conversations
2. **Provide comprehensive medical reference** for patient and providers
3. **Track patterns and correlations** in complex medical data
4. **Maintain accurate historical record** of disease progression
5. **Support informed medical decision-making** with organized data

The goal is systematic, comprehensive, factual medical documentation - not diagnosis or treatment recommendations.
